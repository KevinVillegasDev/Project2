                It's a 5v5 multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) where one team
                attacks and the other defends. The main game mode, Search and
                Destroy, is very similar to CS:GO. The attacking team's goal is
                to plant a bomb (called a spike) and have it detonate, while the
                defending team tries to avoid that. Each player selects an agent
                at the beginning of the game that has unique abilities and plays
                a specific role in the game.
